# Ecommerce Sales & Customer Insights

This is a small data analysis project I created to show my skills as a Data Analyst.

In this project, I used:

- **Google BigQuery** → to run SQL queries on ecommerce data  
- **Python (Pandas)** → to clean and process the data  
- **Power BI** → to create an interactive dashboard  
- **GitHub** → to document and share the project

## Project Workflow

1. I downloaded an Ecommerce dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data).  
2. I uploaded the data into **Google BigQuery**.  
3. I wrote SQL queries to analyze the data (queries are in the `BigQuery_sql/` folder).
4. I have attached SQL queries screenshots (screenshots are in the 'BigQuery_SQL_Screenshots/' folder). 
5. I used Python (Pandas) to clean and transform the data (code is in `Pandas_notebook/`).  
6. I saved the cleaned data as a CSV file.  
7. I built an interactive dashboard in **Power BI** using this cleaned data.  
8. I shared all the files in this GitHub repo for others to view.
